# How can we create a variable

# Creating a variable called name to store user name.
name="Aminah"
# Print is a built-in method used to print the variable, name, to the console
print(name)

# Creating variables called age, hourly_wage and travel_allowance
age = 23
hourly_wage = 5
travel_allowance = 2.4
# Printing the age, hourly_wage
print(travel_allowance)
print(age)
print(hourly_wage)

# Types of Variables in Python
# 1. Strings - Characters encased in " " or ' '.
name="Aminah"
# 2. Integer - A whole number
age = 23
# 3. Float - A number with a decimal
travel_allowance = 2.4
# 4. Boolean - A True or False variable
Hello = True

# How can we take user data?
# We can use a method called input() to get data from user:
username = input('Please enter your name: ') # Getting user data using the input method. This value is then assigned as a variable called name.
print(username)

# How can we find out the type of variable?
# We can use the type() method which gives us the data type.
print(type(name)) ## This should output string
print(type(age)) ## This should ouput integer
print(type(travel_allowance)) ## This should output float
