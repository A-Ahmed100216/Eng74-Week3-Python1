# Python Variables - Practice

# Creating a variable called name to store user name.
name="Mina"
# Print is a built-in method used to print the variable, name, to the console
print(name)

# Creating variables called age, hourly_wage and travel_allowance
age = 23
hourly_wage = 5
travel_allowance = 2.4
# Printing the age, hourly_wage
print(travel_allowance)
print(age)
print(hourly_wage)

# Using input() to get data from user:
username = input('Please enter your name: ') # Getting user data using the input method. This value is then assigned as a variable called name.
print(username)

# Using type() method to give the data type.
print(type(name)) ## This should output string
print(type(age)) ## This should ouput integer
print(type(travel_allowance)) ## This should output float

# Overwriting variables
# If we use the same variable name, it will be rewritten to reflect the most recent variable name. For example,
colour = "Blue"
colour = "Green"
print(colour) # The output will be Green as this was the most recent assignment
